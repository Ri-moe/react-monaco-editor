Monaco Editor for React

A combination of [react-monaco-editor](https://github.com/react-monaco-editor/react-monaco-editor) and [@monaco-editor/react](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react).

```
npm i @rimoe/react-monaco-editor
```

```
yarn add @rimoe/react-monaco-editor
```

Compared to react-monaco-editor, you don't need to configure webpack because we are using a cancelable loader the same as @monaco-editor/react. The core code about Monaco Editor is similar to react-monaco-editor.

But, we don't have a `DiffEditor` yet.

Most of the code in this project is copied from [react-monaco-editor](https://github.com/react-monaco-editor/react-monaco-editor) and [@monaco-editor/react](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react). Both of them are MIT License.
